                            <p>Paul Graham (the founder of Y Combinator) had this piece of advice for high school
                                students that really stuck out to me:</p>
                            <blockquote>‚ÄúWork on things that interest you and increase your options, and worry later
                                about which [options] you‚Äôll take.‚Äù ‚Äî <a id="accentColor"
                                    href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html">Paul Graham</a></blockquote>
                            <p>To explain this idea, he brought up a really interesting analogy of how to fly a glider.
                                If you‚Äôre flying a glider, you don‚Äôt have an engine so eventually, you‚Äôre going to land.
                                But in the meantime, you might as well keep your options open for where to land by
                                staying as high as possible and following winds that help push you up a bit for a little
                                bit.</p>
                            <p>That‚Äôs a good way to show why it‚Äôs preferable to keep your options open (ie. to maximise
                                the number of choices you can make) in life, but I want to take that analogy a bit
                                further. So here goes with my ‚ÄòLife is a Hang Glider Journey‚Äô theory üòâ</p>
                            <hr style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 3em; color: black;">
                            <p>So pretend you‚Äôre launching off a cliff to fly a hang glider and the higher you are, the
                                more amount of choices you have for where to land. This is good, as Paul Graham
                                mentioned.</p>

                            <p>But now, let‚Äôs say <i>your life IS that journey of flying a hang glider‚Ä¶</i></p>

                            <p>I know. Sounds like a very exciting life compared to day-to-day reality indeed üòÅ. When
                                you start off in life, as a baby ‚Äî that‚Äôs like when you first launch into the air. This
                                is when you‚Äôre highest and have the most choice in life.</p>
                            <p>Think about it. You haven‚Äôt been exposed to any biases, you have as much time as you‚Äôre
                                going to get to do [insert choice], and you haven‚Äôt decided to study the basket-weaving
                                major in university‚Ä¶ Overall, your options are pretty open compared to later on in your
                                own life (although different people have a different amount of total options based on
                                things like being lucky enough to be born in a developed country).</p>
                            <p>Now, as you go throughout life and decide to make the decisions you do (ex. learning to
                                weave baskets) ‚Äî you sacrifice some amount of choice with some decisions while gaining
                                more choice with other ones. This is like being propelled higher by air currents vs.
                                being pulled down by gravity. Eventually though, we‚Äôre all going to die and won‚Äôt be
                                able to make any choices anymore because we‚Äôre dead‚Ä¶ which is like crashing the hang
                                glider. üò¨</p>

                            <img src="../assets/img/blog/hang-glider-theory/Splat-min.png" alt=""
                                class="blog-img img-responsive">
                            <p>Now that we‚Äôve defined the inevitable course of this ‚ÄòLife is a Hang Glider Journey‚Äô, we
                                can start to think more about the factors in your decisions that determine whether you
                                have more or less choice in life:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>One factor is definitely time. As you get older, you just have less time to make
                                    choices which limits the total number of choices you can make. In fact, you
                                    eventually die. This leaves you no time to make choices. ü§îThus, several people try
                                    many intriguing plans to extend the amount of time they have in life.</li>
                                <li>Another factor is money. If you make the decision to save $100 each month and get
                                    rich earning interest for decades‚Ä¶ well, now you have more choice in what you can
                                    spend on! On the other hand, if you spend hundreds of dollars every year buying
                                    lottery tickets and never winning‚Ä¶ now, you have less choice in life.</li>
                                <li>Similarly, education also plays a role. If you make the decision to get a university
                                    degree, you have more careers you can work in. You‚Äôll also end up earning more, so
                                    you can maximise the amount of choice you have via money too!</li>
                                <li>What about happiness and relationships? If you have a supportive family that you can
                                    fall back on when making important decisions (ex. like making a career switch or
                                    starting a company), you have more choice in the decisions you make.</li>
                                <li>Wait a minute‚Ä¶</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><i>Isn‚Äôt this just a list full of most things that EVERYONE is trying to obtain in
                                    life???</i> üòÆ</p>
                            <p>Think about what that means. People are pursuing all of these factors in life that all
                                similarly lead to maximising the amount of choice they have. Often, people measure life
                                in the amount of money they have, the amount of time they have, how happy they are, etc.
                                These are like ‚Äòcurrencies‚Äô in life. But I‚Äôd argue that the real currency in life that
                                people are pursuing is not something like money, but choice.</p>
                            <p>When we pursue these other factors in life, we maximise our choice and thus keep our hang
                                glider higher for longer in this ‚ÄòLife as a Hang Glider‚Äô journey. It‚Äôs like taking
                                advantage of uplifting winds that give you more time to stay higher and maximise your
                                choices.</p>
                            <img src="../assets/img/blog/hang-glider-theory/Uplifting-min.png" alt=""
                                class="blog-img img-responsive">

                            <hr style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 3em; color: black;">
                            <p>This can be seen as a crude framework for how to make decisions in life ‚Äî make decisions
                                that maximise the amount of choice you have in life. Pursue the factors that keep your
                                hang glider afloat for longer.</p>
                            <p>For instance, most people in life are confused at some point in their life about what to
                                do during their careers. A crude way to make the decision of which path to go down is to
                                think about which career yields more choice down the line.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Ex. Say you were interested in art and were genuinely torn between doing an
                                    apprenticeship as a wood craftsman vs. as a painter. Well, maybe it‚Äôs better to
                                    learn about being a wood craftsman because if your artistic pursuits don‚Äôt turn out,
                                    you can apply your skills to other industries like manufacturing or construction.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This is a pretty simple question to ask yourself whenever you‚Äôre confused. Before making
                                an important decision, think about whether this is keeping your hang glider afloat. And
                                when a new upwind comes your way as an opportunity, seize it and maximise your options
                                down the line. ‚ú®</p>

                            <h5 class="blog-heading">There are Always Exceptions Though‚Ä¶</h5>
                            <p>For example, say you were learning about computer science and you couldn‚Äôt figure out
                                which area to study. You could specialise in a specific AI technique or be a generalist
                                in recursive algorithms. Well, learning about recursive algorithms probably maximises
                                the number of choices you have on what you could work on, so you would decide to work on
                                that.</p>
                            <p>That said, you might have reasonable evidence to suggest that working on the AI field
                                might be more important in the future than working on recursive algorithms. In this
                                case, it might make more sense to make a decision that leaves you less choice in where
                                you work, but bring greater rewards in other areas of choice like more earnings from
                                your work. üí∏</p>
                            <p>So it‚Äôs not always a hard and fast rule to maximise choice and keep your hang glider
                                afloat as much as possible. Especially considering the difficulties of how you don‚Äôt
                                always know the outcomes of each decision you make when it comes to the amount of choice
                                you have.</p>
                            <p>On the whole though, this is a pretty useful analogy to look at life with. You‚Äôre still
                                on that hang glider right now and you‚Äôll continue making decisions‚Ä¶ that determine the
                                amount of choice you‚Äôll have for the rest of your life!!! So take the next uplifting
                                wind. Maximise the amount of choice you have, because it‚Äôll only be so long until the
                                hang glider crashes and you have none left.</p>
