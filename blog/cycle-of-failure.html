                            <p>And it’s relatively easy to dismiss their words as cliché. That being said, some of these
                                sayings actually hold a lot of value. They’re just often dismissed by the majority of
                                people because they’re not too relatable. One of these sayings for me was to hear
                                successful people talking about how it’s great to embrace failure…</p>

                            <h5 class="blog-heading">Teenagers vs. CEOs</h5>
                            <p>Seriously, for a young teenager who hasn’t really done anything incredible in their life,
                                why would it make sense to think that the best way to learn in life is to fail instead
                                of succeeding? I always just scoffed at that saying (among many others) thinking that
                                these successful people were just being sales-y and trying too hard to be inspirational.
                                😫</p>
                            <p>What the early-teenager version of myself didn’t consider was the possibility that these
                                glamorous CEOs and other successful people TRULY could believe that (instead of just
                                saying fake things to get attention). Later, I even found out WHY they believed this
                                idea about failure… But let’s take a step back.</p>
                            <p>Think about the average teenager in the developed world. For a good portion of teenagers,
                                school is the most major experience of their lives growing up (and at least a very
                                prominent experience for almost everyone). In school, it’s almost ALWAYS encouraged to
                                succeed (and you can easily tell whether you succeed or not based on the mark you get
                                attached to everything you work on). Most of the time, if you’re decently responsible,
                                you don’t fail.</p>
                            <p>Now, contrast this to the world of the CEOs (the world that I, like many other teenagers,
                                didn’t understand at all). CEOs are almost ALWAYS in periods of uncertainty. It’s not
                                easy to tell how successful the endless list of tasks their companies work on are in
                                competitive, fast-paced environments. 😵</p>
                            <p>In one environment, if you fail the next test, you cry about it and if you’re decently
                                responsible, maybe you’ll work harder for the next one. In the other, if you fail at
                                keeping your business profitable, it’s one of the most crushing defeats you could have
                                to deal with… so why would CEOs embrace failure?????</p>

                            <h5 class="blog-heading">Old Me + New Failures = Now I Understand</h5>
                            <p>Recently, I’ve been lucky enough to start experiencing things in life beyond school. The
                                first finding I had? Life beyond school is hard… 😕 There are so many moments of
                                uncertainty I’ve had in the last little while, not knowing how to study for the next
                                hackathon pitch or meeting with a professor.</p>
                            <p>And not all of those moments ended well.</p>
                            <p>In fact, a good chunk (but not the majority) were unfathomably awkward experiences where
                                I don’t know what to say, was sweating from nervousness, and was just trying to put on a
                                smile while there was a little kid running around panicking inside my head 😨. And these
                                experiences kept on happening again and again, the more meetings, pitches, etc. I did.
                            </p>
                            <p>But then I started to notice something new. After having failed at having good pitches or
                                meetings the first 5 or 6 times, I started to learn the same lessons from each one and
                                gradually implement them. Each successive meeting would be slightly less awkward.</p>
                            <p>Was failure somehow helping me succeed????</p>
                            <p>As I started to decrease the number of failures I had in any one area and started
                                succeeding more and more, I had a chance to reflect back on when I dismissed the CEOs a
                                few years earlier. And that’s when I connected the dots:</p>
                            <blockquote>Every time I had succeeded, I was forced to keep on going with the uncertainty,
                                not knowing how things would turn out and take on a larger challenge. When I failed
                                though, I could finally stop to catch my breath, look back on what went wrong, and come
                                out of the experience with a new strategy on how to come closer to success next time.
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>No wonder CEOs liked failure!!! 😄 That was the only time they would be forced to stop
                                and figure out how to best grow, instead of just continuously being hammered by pressure
                                to keep going with uncertainty.</p>

                            <h5 class="blog-heading">What I didn’t Realise</h5>
                            <p>Before I came closer to understanding why failure was important, I needed a key
                                ingredient that I didn’t have in my early teens: experience failing. Before I actually
                                had those years of experience facing uncertain success vs. failing, feeling bad, but
                                then getting better… how could I have compared those two experiences to realise that I
                                preferred the second option to the constant uncertainty of success?</p>
                            <p>My hypothesis on what young people don’t realise is something Dr. Jordan Peterson pointed
                                out very succinctly:</p>
                            <blockquote>“Life is not a game. It’s a series of games.”</blockquote>
                            <p>Young people often don’t have experience with this. We’re always thinking about the next
                                test, the next assignment, the next firm milestone. So when we win or lose these tiny
                                games, it obviously feels much worse to fail than to win.</p>
                            <p>Yet, when I started going out into the real world, where I had more independence about
                                what I do and don’t choose to do and had to face a lot more uncertainty and
                                responsibility… I started to see a new part of the picture of life: the process of
                                reflecting back over the last game you played and preparing for the next one.</p>
                            <p>From doing a presentation in school once a year, I couldn’t realise that it was good to
                                mess up every once in a while to force myself to stop and think back to how I could
                                improve. But from doing 10 presentations a year in many different contexts outside of
                                school, I can now stop focusing on whether I fail the first one so that I can take risks
                                to try something new for the first one and gain skills for all the rest.</p>
                            <p>When it comes to failure in life, Ray Dalio almost perfectly summarised what failure in
                                any individual game looks like for us:</p>
                            <img src="../assets/img/blog/cycle-of-failure/rayDalioCycle.jpg" class="img-responsive"
                                alt="">
                            <p>I could write an entire blog post about this model of failure, but the key idea is that
                                you take on a goal, fail, reflect back on the failure, get better at getting the goal
                                done, and then benefit from the failure to actually succeed with the goal. But what we
                                need to realise about life is that the diagram actually looks like this:</p>
                            <img style="padding-bottom: 3em;"
                                src="../assets/img/blog/cycle-of-failure/cycleOfFailureLong-min.png"
                                class="img-responsive" alt="">
                            <p>I know youth sometimes feel inclined to read these reflections for whatever reason. One
                                of the biggest lessons I could give to my past teenage self is about this cycle of
                                failure. Yes, it doesn’t make sense to embrace failure given what we’re taught in school
                                most of the time. Yes, it sometimes seems like the glamorous CEOs are crazy.</p>
                            <p>But that’s why the best thing you can do to eventually look back on a period of growth
                                after a failure and feel satisfied is just to START TAKING ON CHALLENGES. It is insanely
                                valuable to stop playing games in life and start playing a series of games. So why not
                                start now?</p>
