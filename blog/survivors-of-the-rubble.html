                            <p>He’s just one of the few survivors left in the decimated city of Mosul in Iraq. In 2018,
                                this is the permanent reality for the city’s inhabitants, who have just been freed from
                                the grips of one of the most devastating conflicts in recent history.</p>
                            <p>From 2014 to 2017, it was occupied by the Islamic State (IS) — under the ruthless rule of
                                terrorist fighters — leading to an estimated <a id="accentColor"
                                    href="https://apnews.com/bbea7094fb954838a2fdc11278d65460/9,000-plus-died-in-battle-with-Islamic-State-group-for-Mosul"
                                    target="_blank">11,000 deaths</a> in the city. Nearly a year after the defeat of the
                                IS, these survivors are still largely left alone in this rubble, without any external
                                aid. One man grieves over these years, recounting:</p>
                            <blockquote>“We were waiting to be killed. For three years, the suffering was unbearable.
                                All our lives have been one war after another. War against Iran, war against Kuwait… one
                                war after another”</blockquote>
                            <p>Everywhere around the city, the landscape looks the same. The rubble of buildings lays
                                upon other buildings, all destroyed from years of airstrikes, bombings, and other
                                conflict. Countless possessions lay scattered along the ground, from misshappen clocks
                                to dismantled cars to torn clothes — still adorning the corpses of the deceased that
                                remain strewn amidst the rubble.</p>

                            <p>Amidst this desolate landscape, a few survivors remain to recount the stories of their
                                harrowing experiences in the past few years. At the peak of the conflict, there was open
                                rebellion and conflict between the Shiite and Sunni Muslims in the region. A conflict
                                that left disastrous consequences.</p>
                            <p>One elderly man climbs through rubble in the city, grieving over haunting memories of the
                                past. He stops to hold out the passports of his former family members, narrating:</p>
                            <blockquote>“All the politicians, the military, the heads of state… when they drop their
                                bombs, do they ever think of the people? This was my wife. These were my two sons. This
                                was my elder daughter. This was my younger one… she was my favourite. Now, they’re all
                                dead. I wish I had died with them.”</blockquote>
                            <p>Conflict ended in the region in July 2017. Eight months later, the city looks very much
                                the same as the one left in the grips of this atrocious conflict. Every survivor seems
                                to tell a similar story. One of lost sons and daughters. One of lost parents and
                                spouses. One of an entire way of life lost with only the remnants of hollow homes and
                                hearts to show.</p>
                            <p>The survivor scanning the rubble of Mosul from a destroyed rooftop is scavenging through
                                these homes, searching for corpses of the dead still waiting to be cleaned up. He states
                                he has adjusted to this reality now, where the work — any sort of work — is all that’s
                                left him to distract him from the misery:</p>
                            <blockquote>“At some point, you start to forget. It’s good that god has given us the gift of
                                forgetting. Every time I come here, it makes me sad. I go out, keep myself busy, help
                                out with the corpses. I can’t stay longer than an hour. If I stay longer, I get
                                depressed.”</blockquote>
                            <p>As the working men continue on trying to slowly clear the rubble and restore the barren
                                city, the other members of families watch on trying to comprehend this new nightmare
                                that they’ve been haphazardly been dropped into. One young girl, walks amongst broken
                                roads, discussing past events with an elderly man, who perhaps may be her grandfather.
                            </p>
                            <p>She seems bizarrely used to the bleak reality around her, carrying a sense of composure
                                not expected of any youth — especially not one in the position in life that she is in.
                                She looks squarely in front of her with an indifferent tone as she relives the horrors
                                she had seen:</p>
                            <blockquote>“One old man looked so terrible: his stomach was sliced open and his guts were
                                spilling out. I couldn’t sleep at night — it looked so horrible.”</blockquote>
                            <p>Another boy gathers with his family in front of a crumbling wall displaying countless
                                fluttering sheets of paper — each with dozens of names listed on it, recording the
                                missing family-members being sought after by broken families.</p>

                            <p>He describes his fluttering hope to find his lost father, not fully knowing whether his
                                father is alive:</p>
                            <blockquote>“I’m here because of my father. Members of the IS arrested him on January 31st,
                                2017… We will file a missing person’s report. If someone knows something, they should
                                contact us. I hope we find him.”</blockquote>
                            <p>It’s a similar picture for the state of the wandering mothers and wives amidst the
                                crowds. They come back week after week to search for any news of their lost sons and
                                husbands — often if only to find closure in realising they can stop searching for the
                                fallen. One mother sobs as she tells of her family’s continuous losses as the war
                                progressed:</p>
                            <blockquote>There’s no one left. My parents died, so did my only brother… my husband too. My
                                sons were all I had… My house could burn down and I would live in a tent, if only my
                                children were here with me. That’s my only wish.”</blockquote>
                            <p>The most prevalent question among these survivors’ minds is not about the fate of their
                                fallen family, however. It is about the foggy future that soon awaits these fractured
                                circles of outcasts. Especially the young among them. As time passes on to the end of
                                2018, the lives of children consist mainly of scrounging through the rubble to scavenge
                                any pawnable items off of dead corpses.</p>

                                of children running across a war zone to gather the few resources they can from the
                                corpses no longer in need of them. One man looks on and comments:</p>
                            <blockquote>“The most important question is this: is anything being done to rebuild people’s
                                lives? No sustained effective longterm measures are being taken to educate to educate or
                                train young people. Or to further their abilities. Or to emancipate women. Nothing is
                                being done. The people of Mosul will continue to suffer.”</blockquote>
                            <p>In the background of this stark reality for the Iraqi citizens, there is another group of
                                former nationals suffering in the shadows. The family members of former IS soldiers are
                                now blatantly ostracised and rejected by the surviving Iraqi— many of whom had lost
                                their own family due to the invasion of the IS. The tensions of revenge hang heavily in
                                the dusty air.</p>
                            <p>One elderly woman surreptitiously makes her way through the rubble so as to not draw
                                attention. Her time is now spent with her two orphaned grandchildren in sleeper cells.
                                The mother of a former IS fighter, she describes the threats now facing her remaining
                                family at the hands of the reinstated Iraqi government:</p>
                            <blockquote>“They scrawled Islamic State on our houses. Even if wiped away, people know who
                                the houses belong to. Our children are not allowed to go to school. All their rights
                                have been taken away from them. They can’t even get identity cards. Even NGOs turn us
                                away… it’s not the children’s fault.”</blockquote>
                            <p>The woman has increasingly justified fears of this retribution as the government presence
                                in Mosul grows. There are more and more Iraqi troops patrolling the city, searching for
                                hidden IS members yet to be found. The danger is far from over in the region, as
                                isolated extremists still continue to perpetrate terrorist attacks on civilians.</p>

                            <p>In addition to the military presence, there are also increased political dynamics at play
                                with the rebuilding of the historic city. Where now lie mountains of rubble, there once
                                stood monuments dating back several centuries. As a result, there is both international
                                and local attention on the region as rebuilding efforts commence.</p>
                            <p>Representatives from across the world are evaluating the lost heritage sites that must be
                                dug up amidst ancient broken stones as part of initiatives with the United Nations
                                Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Similarly, the United
                                Nations Development Programme(UNDP) is charged with implementing aid to reconstruct
                                thousands of homes, schools, and hospitals to restore vitality to the region.</p>

                            <p>Millions of euros are being funnelled into Mosul for this purpose. Yet, the region’s
                                relentless record of bribery and corruption still are entrenched in local governance.
                                While cooperation between local and international authorities stalls due to lack of
                                transparency in the allocation of funds, angry hoards of protestors clamour as the
                                people of Mosul are inevitably the ones still left suffering.</p>
                            <p>One couple walks away from it all to survey the graves of their six children,
                                indistinguishable from the thousands of others extending out as far as the eye can see.
                                As they start sobbing amidst this new world of rubble, they pose their questions in vain
                                to an ominously-silent fate:</p>
                            <blockquote>“Why don’t we have a right to live? Why has Mosul suffered? I don’t understand…
                                why Mosul?</blockquote>

                            <hr class="blog">

                            <p>Across the shores of a vast ocean, in another part of the world, the effects of this
                                conflict continue to ripple outwards. On the shores of Lesvos, Greece, the sunset
                                illuminates the spray of waves crashing on the beaches of the doorway of Europe. Yet,
                                there is little beauty in this seemingly elegant picture.</p>

                            <p>Instead, the sunset reveals an overcrowded raft of desperate people yearning for a better
                                life, escaping the rubble-strewn lands of the middle east in search of a new horizon
                                that brings new hope. Every day, more and more refugees surrender their lives to the
                                unforgiving waves, playing their odds with the cold currents in hopes of a better
                                future.</p>
                            <p>There are thousands of refugees on this island, just a small part of the 60 million that
                                were displaced in 2015. Yet, the overwhelming number of refugees on Lesvos all share a
                                unity in the challenges they have been through, even as more join their ranks from the
                                sea every day. One young boy describes the connection he feels to other refugees, down
                                to the perilous journeys that brought them to this new land:</p>
                            <blockquote>“When [the boat] capsized, everyone fell into the water. No one died. The coast
                                guard saved us, they took us here to the island. Five more minutes, and we would have
                                all been dead. We were 6 children, so I was scared for my younger siblings. I feared for
                                them, and for my mother and father.”</blockquote>
                            <p>Numerous others haven’t been so fortunate. Many refugees in Lesbos know family members
                                that have drowned during this journey. Thus, new arrivals jump joyously off the
                                overladen boats to kiss this newfound land. On the side, however, one man is left
                                wistfully gazing at an old picture on his phone of the brother he left behind:</p>
                            <blockquote>“Whenever I recall my time in prison, I remember my brother. He was a good man.
                                His crime was helping people. He never used to even eat or sleep at night. Just so he
                                could go out and distribute food. This was the crime we committed… I used to beg the
                                guards to put me out of my misery. I wanted to die just so I could have some sort of
                                relief.”</blockquote>
                            <p>Another young woman is similarly lost in thought, pondering upon the possibilities of her
                                childhood lost in war:</p>
                            <blockquote>“What angers me the most is that wherever I went in Syria, I saw the injured. I
                                would see the dead. I would see blood. All the people dearest to me have been killed by
                                this war. No one is left. As it happens in war, people die.”</blockquote>
                            <p>This reality on seemingly distant European shores is fuelled by the conflicts amidst the
                                cities of rubble farther East. Europe represents a new beginning in life away from the
                                unspeakable conflicts from just a few months prior for these refugees. That being said,
                                most are shocked by the surprising conflicts they come to face in this land of
                                prosperity. One man describes his experience amidst his temporary home in Lesvos:</p>
                            <blockquote>“I don’t have a country. I’m adrift. No one asks about me. It’s like I’m from
                                another planet. No one looks at me.”</blockquote>
                            <p>The refugees live in temporary containers, fit more so for freight than people. Children
                                wander around on overcrowded beaches, entertaining themselves through this new chapter
                                of struggles in their turbulent lives.</p>

                            <p>Still, this reality is far better than the hollow cities left behind by the refugees,
                                leaving many hopeful for a brighter future. Most expect additional changes to their
                                lives as they continue moving from one uncertain land to another, yet many are hopeful
                                to find their place in the world that they had lost. One man describes his surprising
                                gratitude for life in these challenging times:</p>
                            <blockquote>“I feel this is a great experience. To finally see the ‘real’ world. By this, I
                                mean the civilised world, a human world. Where human life is really valued. On the
                                contrary, I am proud now to be a refugee.”</blockquote>
                            <p>While a mother dreams for her children to live through the future she was robbed of:</p>
                            <blockquote>“As long as there are human beings, there is hope. As long as there is a chance
                                for our children to grow, there is hope.”</blockquote>
                            <p>And a young woman asserts her conviction that a better world is waiting for her:</p>
                            <blockquote>“This is why I’m going to Germany. To start a new life. To see the future that
                                was waiting for me as a child.”</blockquote>
                            <p>As the mayor of Lesvos, Spyros Gallinos, hears more and more of the relentlessly harsh
                                realities faced by the resilient refugees at his doorstep — at Europe’s doorstep — he
                                describes the inspiration he finds in working to help these unceasingly hopeful people
                                that emerged from the rubble:</p>
                            <blockquote>“We have seen people lose their lives a few metres from our coast. We have seen
                                young children lose their mothers and mothers lose their children. And this, we cannot
                                bear. For them, this island represents hope, it represents European civilisation. And we
                                need to be worthy of their hope.”</blockquote>
                            <p>From the limited perspective of those another world apart from this conflict, most people
                                in these lands of hope know nothing of the world of rubble. They are themselves like the
                                wanderers climbing atop mountains of rubble that cede away to shocking new reality. As
                                these stories from Lesvos and Mosul and the many other lands of rubble spread, however,
                                it is up to them to choose whether to help rebuild the ruins, or watch another people
                                return to rubble.</p>
