                            </div>

                            <p>The funny thing is, the reason I was watching this was because I was sadder than I‚Äôd ever
                                been in 4 months.</p>
                            <p><i>Gee, what got you in this mess of emotions?</i></p>
                            <p>Well, I'd been trying to painstakingly maintain relationships virtually during COVID-19
                                for 9 months. One day, I just stopped and thought of every friend I had. 85% of my
                                friends hadn't ONCE reached out to me before I reached out to them in the last little
                                whileüò¢</p>
                            <p><i>Ummm, why do I need to know this?</i></p>
                            <p>Well, this one standup routine taught me how to deal with the confusion of trying
                                (unsuccessfully) to get what I want out of life.</p>
                            <hr class="blog">

                            <p><i>Okayyy, what's so important about this standup routine?</i></p>
                            <p>Oversimplified summary: the short guy (Costello) is joining a new baseball team. He wants
                                the manager to tell him his teammate's names before he meets them‚Ä¶ and he just CANNOT
                                understand the manager at all. I'll let you <a
                                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=40&v=kTcRRaXV-fg&feature=youtu.be"
                                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">watch</a> it yourself to see why it's
                                funny üòÅ</p>
                            <p>But the key message is that two people can say the exact same things and have completely
                                different meanings behind them. And when one person's trying to get to their goal, it's
                                just rid-ON-culously hilarious how often misunderstanding and misalignments can put a
                                dash in your plans. There are at least SOME times you'll also struggle with this in the
                                real world.</p>
                            <p><i>But how well could a 1953 comedy act apply to today's world???</i></p>
                            <p>Well, just take a look at everything around you. I bet you'll see at least one thing that
                                was created by humans just like you. (And in COVID-19 lockdowns, almost EVERYTHING you
                                see indoors is probably man-made).</p>
                            <p>But notice that none of those things are absolutely perfect. You don't go around all day
                                thinking about JUST HOW PERFECT your water bottle or your wall is! It's like people got
                                together to create those things one way, but there are always little imperfections from
                                that design. I think that's fundamental to human-made things. It's just very easy to get
                                incentives misaligned slightly and very hard to get them aligned how you envision them
                                to be.</p>
                            <p>For example, take driving down the road. Everything from the road signs to the parking
                                lots on the side to the drivers following certain rules happened because of humans
                                working together. But if you've ever been driving on a road, you KNOW one of those
                                things is going to be broken at any given moment üòÖ</p>

                            <img src="../assets/img/blog/wantWhatYouGet/car-jam.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive"
                                style="padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 2em;">

                            <p>Well, the architect who designed the road doesn't get exactly what they envisioned
                                because some driver's in a hurry and is cutting off other traffic. Just like that, tiny
                                misalignments of incentives exist in so many things you do!</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Getting a relationship to work how you want</li>
                                <li>Being able to communicate to others how you intended</li>
                                <li>Being able to align a team on a common goal</li>
                                <li>Getting those annoying drivers to stop cutting you off‚Ä¶ üòñ</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><i>But everything around me still exists! How bad could misaligned incentives be?</i></p>
                            <p>Well, yes. Everything does get done to some degree. But no one ends up with the exact
                                outcome they want. It's like we're always pushing for what we want and falling back to
                                what we get. So why do we so often keep pushing for perfection, though we know it's
                                probably never going to happen?</p>
                            <p>I bet that even in your life today, you've caught yourself reminiscing about changing the
                                past (remember that one awkward conversation‚Ä¶?) or planning the future (which shirt to
                                wear for yet another day of Zoom meetings‚Ä¶?) üòâ</p>
                            <p>Most people are constantly trying to FORCE the world to give us what we want‚Ää-‚Ääeven when
                                the past moments we're thinking about can no longer be changed and the future moments
                                can't take place now. And at the end of the day, everyone sees the world through the
                                incentives of what they want to get‚Ä¶ and those are REALLY hard to align!</p>
                            <p>But if life always has these kerfuffles of conflicting incentives, why can't we just
                                accept that we'll have to accept things? Wouldn't it be simpler to understand the areas
                                where incentives are usually kerfuffled (ex. relationships) and train ourselves to want
                                what we get instead of trying to get what we want?</p>
                            <p><i>And my fine sir, I prithee tell‚Ä¶ HOW exactly shalst I do that???</i></p>
                            <p>*What, you don't speak like that? üòÅ</p>
                            <p>Well, luckily for you, THAT is exactly what I've been learning about in my ups and downs
                                of sadness. Here are some tips to learn to want what you get:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Remember, nothing is certain. Things could just as easily go right as left. So why
                                    bother figuring it out? Just have a kid's voice say in your head: "Well, I don't
                                    know WHAT'S going on, but I bet I'll have fun when it does!" *The kid's voice is
                                    absolutely paramount üòÑ</li>
                                <li>Just stop and notice JUST HOW AWESOME one tiny thing around you is! This morning, I
                                    woke up feeling sad about a broken friendship. Then, I just started watching the
                                    music video for the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbZSe6N_BXs"
                                        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Happy</a> by Pharrell Williams!
                                    There's no WAY you can watch that without smiling and being happy about something as
                                    small as watching a videoüòÆ</li>
                                <li>Keep an eye out for the small opportunities that pop up. Then, you can just start
                                    wanting to get them (and KNOW you can get them too)! For example, I was out jogging
                                    in the rain the other day and I accidentally stepped into a puddle. My feet were
                                    cold, so that was inconvenient. But then, I just said, "HEY‚Ä¶ I haven't splashed in
                                    puddles on purpose since I was like 7. Now's my moment to shine!!!!" I splashed in
                                    EVERY puddle on the way back home and my mother was SO mad about the mess üòÇ</li>
                                <li>And of course, it could always be worse. If you're frustrated in high school about
                                    the boring assignments and a sore back from sitting all day, just think: "Well, when
                                    I'm 60 and have a sore EVERYTHING, I'm probably going to wish I could be in high
                                    school and ONLY have a sore back." It's like you're constantly living in the 'good
                                    old days' in some way, because SOMEthing will get worse later. So even if
