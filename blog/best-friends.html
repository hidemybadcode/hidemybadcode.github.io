              <p>When I was 8, I immigrated to Canada from India knowing limited English, not understanding social
                norms, and not having the same lunches that the cool kids at school would every day üòÅ</p>
              <p>Suffice it to say, I did NOT have an easy time making friends when I immigrated (although at least I
                still loved Indian food üòâ). I remember my teachers pairing me up with 'school buddies' that would show
                me the way and were my first friends.</p>
              <p>Over the years though, I've met a lot of good people that helped my family and I through our immigrant
                experiences‚Ä¶ including some pretty good friends.</p>
              <p>That said, it's only recently that I've found my BEST friends (recently meaning years later üòï). And
                having a best friend is so amazing, I wanted to just take a second to reflect on what makes a good
                friend vs. a best friend!</p>

              <hr class="blog">

              <p>The biggest factor for introverts like me is vulnerability. Usually, I'd keep most issues to myself and
                wouldn't really talk about problems with most people I was friendly towards. But the BEST friends got to
                hear ALL the random rants about how my world domination plan didn't go right on that particular day üòâ
              </p>
              <p>And the thing is, you don't feel uncomfortable talking about those kinds of details with your BEST
                friend. It's like they're a second brain to process information along with you! I can easily visualise
                all the times where my BEST friends and I would just walk around schoolyards as kids and talk and talk
                and talk and never get bored of sharing all the good AND bad experiences together!</p>
              <p>This is the key factor in differentiating BEST friends from good friends. Good friends are there to
                have fun with and make happy memories.</p>

              <blockquote>But BEST friends are the ones who keep sticking around after the happy stuff and make it okay
                to be¬†sad.</blockquote>

              <p>And on the note of being comfortable around BEST friends, BEST friends also don't come with social
                norms to follow. If your BEST friend annoys you and you decide to get your revenge with a tickle war (at
                the age of 17‚Ä¶), that's perfectly fine üòú You do get a few weird stares (especially if you undertake
                this revenge in the middle of a crowded city street), but it doesn't matter as much when you're having
                fun with your BEST friend!</p>
              <p>And speaking of your BEST friend annoying you‚Ää-‚Ääthe following are THE most accurate representations of
                how any argument with a BEST friend goes:</p>

              <!-- Image embed -->
              <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="../assets/img/blog/best-friends/madAtFriend1.png"
                style="border: 1px solid #000; margin-bottom: 2em; margin-top: 2em;" alt="">
              <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="../assets/img/blog/best-friends/madAtFriend2.jpg"
                style="border: 1px solid #000; margin-bottom: 2em;" alt="">

              <p>That said, even if things aren't going well for a little bit, you don't have to worry with a BEST
                friend. BEST friends have a habit of sticking around through the largest of challenges. For example, I
                had this BEST friend for 2‚Äì3 years when I was younger and then my family moved across the country. Even
                after I hadn't seen him after several years, he was visiting one day and we just picked up being friends
                like normal and went to the aquarium to look at fish. Because we both still knew that I like fish üòÅ</p>
              <p>Still, BEST friends aren't always nice to have around. In fact, BEST friends have a habit of telling
                you harsh things that other people won't in a confoundingly non-apologetic way. üòñ It's sometimes
                annoying to consider how they'll be nice to everyone else, but tell you what they REALLY think about
                your stupid decisions, but that just goes to show how much you trust each other!</p>
              <p>And finally, BEST friends start good work, whereas good work starts friends (usually regular ones). Ie.
                You and your bestie were a #team long before you knew what you were teaming up on üòÄ Interesting
                escapades have a habit of coming over and over again with your BEST friend.</p>
              <p>So thank you to all the BEST friends out there. You genuinely make someone else's life so different,
                they couldn't imagine it without you üíØ And thank you to all of my best friends, who gave me so many
                stories that I couldn't list any of them in this blog post without each of the points above turning into
                a book‚Ä¶ üòïüòÖ</p>
              <p>And as for the people reading this, if you find someone that checks off all the following boxes:</p>
              <strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>Makes it okay for you to be vulnerable</li>
                  <li>Makes it okay to not always worry about society's rules</li>
                  <li>Is the one you can only be mad at for 5 minutes</li>
                  <li>Sticks with you throughout all the challenges</li>
                  <li>Is honest with you even with harsh details</li>
                  <li>Is your go-to partner for whatever you're starting</li>
                </ul>
              </strong>
              <p>AND still has way too many amazing parts of them to describe in a simple list‚Ä¶ hold that person close
                and treasure their friendship, because you only find someone like that once in a long long time¬†:-)</p>
